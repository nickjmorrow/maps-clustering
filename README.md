# Geospatial Clustering of Google Maps Locations

The demo can be found [here](https://geoclustering.netlify.app/).

## At a Glance

This is a .NET Core application that takes an uploaded .kml file and clusters the locations using [agglomerative hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Agglomerative_clustering_example).

## What Is It For

When I moved to New York in 2018, I had a long list of places to visit. I thought it could be fun to try clustering them together to "maximize the number of places I could visit in a weekend." I ended up spending more time working on this app than visiting places when I got here, but it's still been fun to make!

## Technical Stack: .NET Core / C#, React, SQL Server

- The **front-end** is built using React with heavy reliance on a [personal component library](https://github.com/nickjmorrow/react-component-library).
- For **state management**, I'm using Redux. This isn't required because I don't need to perform any complex mutations of the data, but it has been nice for debugging and having a clearer idea of data flow throughout the front-end.
- For the **back-end**, I'm using a .NET Core Web API deployed to Heroku using Docker. Throughout the project, I've enjoyed relying on C#'s static type system while working with the complicated data structure passed to the front-end to allow on-the-fly clustering.
- For the **database**, I'm using Postgres and [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) for hosting.

## Callouts

### Computation and Performance

- The locations are clustered only once, and then sent in a form to the FE that allows the user to change certain inputs while not kicking off new expensive calculations. I like how this makes the UI a bit more zippy and exploratory.

## What could be added to it

- It would be nice to have a better fallback UI for when locations haven't been loaded.
- Optimal path finding could be cool, to know what order to visit the locations within a cluster.

## What are the expectations of it

I fully intend for this to just be a hobby project that I check up on now and then.

## How to run it

For the front-end:

```
npm run start
```

For the back-end:

```
dotnet run
```

Note that I use environment variables in [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for the connection string to the database - that should be swapped out with information to your own database.
